# U3S4 Keyboard Input

## Exercise 1
### Part 1
- Create a new project and add the Input01.javafile to the project
- Create a `JOptionPane`:
- `NetBeanswill` complain
- Follow the `NetBeans` suggestion of importing `javax.swing.JOptionPane`
- We’ll cover importing in another section
### Part 2
- Store this input as a `String`
- Print the `String` variable
- Parse the `String` as a separate int variable
  - You’ll need to input a value that can be parsed
  - Print this value `+1`
- Try creating a dialog box, parsing it, and initializing an `int` in a single line
- You should have only one semicolon (;)

## Exercise 2
- Create a new project and add the `Input02.java` file to the project
- Experiment with the code and try to change…
  - The message title
  - The message
  - Any default input text
  - The dialog box’s icon
- Parse, manipulate, and print any input

## Exercise 3
- Create a new project and add the `Input03.java` file to the
project
- Create a Scanner:
  - Your `IDE` will complain
  - Follow your `IDE's` suggestion of importing `java.util.Scanner`
  - Remember to close the Scanner
- Use `Scanner` and `System.in` to write a program that …
  - Finds and prints the sum of three integers entered by the user
- Try entering less than three tokens
- Try entering a token that can’t be parsed as an `int`

## Exercise 4
### Part 1
- Create a new project and add the `Input04.java`file to the project
- Run the code and examine the output
- Read through each next line until you find "`BlueBumper`"
- The two numbers following "`BlueBumper`" are the object’s `xPositon` and `yPosition`
- Store these coordinates as `integers` and print them
- Examine `input04text.txt`, if necessary
### Part 2
- Examine `Level05.txt` if you’re curious:
  - This is how level data is stored for `Java Puzzle Ball`
  - Reading and parsing level data is slightly more complicated than what you’ve done in this exercise
  - But if you finished this exercise, you’re close to understanding how
it’s done
